While the first term of the government introduced three major regulatory changes - GST, IBC and RERA - the first Budget of the new term introduces necessary reforms to streamline the tax and regulatory framework to achieve the overall objective of a $5 trillion economy. The vision for the second term is driven by the expansion of physical and financial infrastructure, Digital India, Make in India, start-ups, giving clear signs that India has a clear plan to challenge the manufacturing strength of China.\n",
            "\n",
            "In order to boost the economic growth in India, in line with the Make in India policy, and attract technology to the country, the government will launch a scheme to invite global companies through transparent bidding to set up mega manufacturing plants in sunrise and advanced technology areas such as semiconductor fabrication. The scheme will also include units in the fields of solar photovoltaic cells, lithium storage batteries, solar electric charging infrastructure, computers servers, laptops etc. In order to incentivise them, they are offered investment-linked income tax deduction and certain indirect tax benefits.\n",

This is also accompanied with an extension in the period of exemption of capital gains arising from the sale of a residential house for the investment in startups up to 31 March 2021.\n",
            "\n",
            "Digital transactions have led to increased transparency and tax collections so far. In order to move further, a 2 percent TDS has been proposed on cash withdrawals exceeding Rs 1 crore in a financial year from a bank account. Business establishments with an annual turnover of more than Rs 50 crore would be required to offer low cost digital modes of payments to its customers.\n",

This is a step taken to encourage offshore investments.\n",

            "Increasing minimum public shareholding threshold from 25 percent to 35 percent is a move to increase public participation and governance of listed companies. In the case of many mid-cap and small stocks, it was better to have more promoter involvement in the market, since India’s capital market is still in a developing phase. This might lead many MNCs listed on Indian exchanges to consider the option of delisting, if increased public shareholding is implemented. However, clarity would be required on timeline and mode of increase of shareholding, including on grandfathering provisions.\n",

            "The Honorable FM, in order to boost FDI, allowed 100 percent FDI in insurance intermediaries and will additionally examine the opening up of FDI in aviation, the media sector and the animation, video, graphics and comics (AVGC) industry. This move would ease the process to find buyers for stressed aviation companies like Jet Airways, Air India etc. It has been proposed to implement the essential elements of the regulatory roadmap for making India a hub for aircraft financing and leasing activities from Indian shores and growth in India of Maintenance, Repair and Overhaul (MRO) industry. Local sourcing norms would be eased in Single Brand Retail sector, which would encourage foreign players to explore the Indian retail sector.\n",

Further, with a view to widen the scope of investible stocks available to FPIs in the Indian market, it was also proposed to increase the statutory limit for FPI investment in a company from 24 percent to sectoral foreign investment limit, with the option given to concerned corporates to limit to a lower threshold.

            "\n",
            "The first Budget of the Modi 2.0 government has disappointed most observers of the agriculture scene. They expected that the government, having won an unprecedented mandate, will kick in structural changes through the Budget. But the government’s refusal to take the plunge shows that victory in election is not enough to undertake deep reforms and a political consensus is required before decisions affecting crores of people can be taken.\n",
            "\n",
            "In the case of reforms in the financial sector, the finance minister did not feel a similar handicap. So, she did take several welcome steps towards reforms.\n",
            "\n",
            "The Modi 2.0 government was formed only on May 30 and it had just about a month to prepare the Budget proposals. In such a short time, it would not have been possible to consult the states, even if they are ruled by the BJP. After demonetisation, analysts are of the view that the government can take any decision in the interest of economy. But that was a one-off decision even if it affected every single individual in the country.\n",
            "\n",
            "Agricultural experts wished to see bold decision-making on rationalisation of food and fertiliser subsidies and cropping patterns. The observation is that even though direct benefit transfer through PM-Kisan was launched on the eve of Parliament elections, it has laid the foundation for direct transfer of subsidies in a phased manner and the government will present a road map for the same.\n",
            "\n",
            "For 2019-20, the Budget provides Rs 1.84 lakh crore and Rs 80,000 crore for food and fertiliser subsidies. In 2018-19, the government had provided Rs 1.40 lakh crore towards food subsidy to the Food Corporation of India (FCI) and Rs 31,000 crore for state governments, which procure food grains under the decentralised procurement scheme (DCP). In the interim Budget presented on February 1, the allocations were increased in revised estimate (RE) to Rs 1.51 lakh crore and Rs 33,000 crore, respectively.\n",
            "\n",
            "But the government did not pay the RE amount, and the FCI received Rs 69,000 crore less than RE. The outstanding dues of the FCI reached Rs 1.85 lakh crore as on March 31. DCP states are also running with substantial arrears of food subsidy though the amount is not known as the data are not released by the government. In fact, one of the reasons why the states are reluctant to undertake procurement at MSP is the delay in reimbursement of subsidy, even for rice and wheat. The states end up incurring substantial losses in procurement. Chhattisgarh and Odisha have been representing to the Centre about the delay in reimbursement of food subsidy.\n",
            "\n",
            "Similarly, the government owes Rs 30,000 crore to fertiliser companies as arrear of fertiliser subsidy.\n",
            "\n",
            "Sitharaman’s Budget for 2020 made no reference to mounting arrears of food subsidy. We wanted to hear the FM on her government’s thinking on reform of food subsidy regime. A road map to switch to DBT for food in at least agriculturally surplus states like Punjab, Haryana and Andhra Pradesh was expected in the Budget, but it seems that the government did not want to touch it even after a huge mandate.\n",
            "\n",
            "Even the Economic Survey only talked about end-to-end computerisation of public distribution system. For a large number of migrants working at places away from their home, DBT for food is the road to one nation, one ration card. But it was not to be.\n",
            "\n",
            "For phosphatic and potassic fertilisers, the UPA had brought Nutrient Based Subsidy Scheme in 2010. In the five years of the Modi 1.0 government, subsidy on urea was not touched. The Budget for 2020 again does not provide any road map for that.\n",
            "\n",
            "The FM mentioned zero based budget farming, which has been undertaken in some coastal districts of Andhra Pradesh. Without any reform in fertiliser subsidy regime, it is unrealistic to expect farmers to use less urea and switch over to organic farming.\n",
            "\n",
            "Several regions of India are reeling under drought and water stress has become one of the most pressing challenges for farming. The FM took notice of this and mentioned that there are 1,592 critical and over exploited blocks. But she did not indicate how the government proposes to address this enormous challenge.\n",
            "\n",
            "Experts have been writing about the need to modify cropping patterns in several regions of India. There is no doubt that it is not going to be an easy exercise, but a token provision in the Budget would have shown the government’s seriousness to tackle this challenge.\n",
            "\n",
            "There is a realisation that farmers can realise better prices only if marketing reforms are undertaken. The FM did mention it in passing, but it would require a lot of convincing of state governments as APMCs would not easily let their influence go. A more emphatic statement in the Budget speech would have given a signal of the government’s commitment to reform the agricultural markets.\n",
            "\n",
            "The FM has spoken about promotion of milk sector through cooperatives. In the past 10 years, the private sector has taken lead in setting up milk processing plants. In several large states, like UP, the procurement of milk by cooperatives has gone down. If the Food Safety and Standard Authority of India (FSSAI) is as strict with the unorganised sector as it is with the organised one, the milk sector can see large investment by private players.\n",
            "\n",
            "Even though doubling of farm income does not find a mention in the Budget speech, allied sectors like rearing of animals, dairy, fisheries, forestry etc do provide a window for increase in farmers income, especially in poorer states in east India.\n",
            "\n",
            "Modi 2.0 has set up a high-powered committee of chief ministers for transformation of Indian agriculture. It seems that the government wants to wait for report of the committee and then build a consensus on road map for deep reforms in agriculture and food sector.\n",

It would open funding avenues for financially-sound NBFCs and provide partial credit guarantee for public sector banks for the purchase of pooled assets of financially-sound NBFCs.\n",

This is expected to provide more uniform regulatory environment to the lending segment. Steps have been taken through tax measures to bring deposit taking NBFCs and systematically important non-deposit taking NBFCs at par with banks and other public financial institutions. Measures to support financially sound NBFCs and higher regulatory RBI monitoring will lead to drive for consolidation of NBFCs.\n",

            "In the tri-party repo market in corporate debt securities, an arrangement to allow AA-rated bonds as collaterals was envisaged. It was proposed to allow investments made by FIIs/FPIs in debt securities issued by Infrastructure Debt Fund – Non-Bank Finance Companies (IDF-NBFCs) to be transferred/sold to any domestic investor within the specified lock-in period.

            "\n",
            "In 2014, the Modi 1.0 government launched the Pradhan Mantri Jan Dhan Yojana (PMJDY) in a bid to bring about this rural population into mainstream of banking and finance.\n",
            "\n",
            "This “people’s wealth” programme was formulated in order to bring about financial inclusion and provide low-cost, affordable financial services to everyone in the country especially for the rural economy. PMJDY was implemented to reduce disposable income and marked the advent of Direct Bank Transfers (DBT) to bank accounts.\n",
            "\n",
            "This flagship scheme led to a surge in the number of bank accounts that were opened in the wake. Given the many benefits underlined it, which included zero balance account and insurance cover of Rs 2,00,000, the scheme was bound to be a thriving success. Each beneficiary was also issued a RuPay debit card for ATM withdrawals, along with an overdraft facility of Rs 10,000.\n",

            "The scheme rolled out with a national biometrics programme, Aadhaar to revolutionise financial inclusion through JAM (Jan Dhan-Aadhaar-Mobile) in areas with mobile connectivity.\n",
            "\n",
            "The Global Findex Report 2017, released by the World Bank heralded India’s exponential growth in the field of financial inclusion to PMJDY. According to the report, the number of account holders in India had grown from 53 percent in 2014 to 80 percent in 2017. However, the report also clearly cites that a half of these accounts remain dormant.\n",

            "Government data suggested that there were 35.29 crore accounts under the ambit of PMJDY with a total deposit balance of Rs 96,107.35 crore, as of in March 2019. As per the government reports, the deposits and account holders have steadily increased over the period of five years, set to cross on lakh crore deposits.\n",

            "\n",
            "Abhinav Prakash Singh, Economist and Asst. Professor at SRCC, mentioned that the PMJDY had been proficient in encouraging financial inclusion. But, the problem between policy making and implementation within the complimentary ecosystem still lingers.\n",
            "\n",
            "“In terms of rural sector inclusion, financial unawareness and lack of cooperation from Bank managers in terms of imparting knowledge to unaware beneficiaries in most rural areas, have forced people from rural economy to maintain distance from formal banking.”\n",
            "\n",
            "He further added, “As per the unbanked places are concerned, the physical strain of visiting the banks have also stopped the rural people from indulging in the financial spectrum of the economy. Hence they find it beneficial to visit money lenders and borrow money via oral dealings.”\n",
            "\n",
            "Singh stated, “Financial literacy is extremely important for total inclusion as most people belonging to the rural sector find banking extremely scary whether in term of lending borrowing or even the documentation process. The banking sector has merely achieved only a limited level of penetration and financial literacy is a healthy way to remove the fear of paper work from these people. \"\n",
            "\n",
            "Sulakshana Razdan, a Central Bank employee who has worked in Neemrana in rural Rajasthan for three years, mentioned that one of the major reasons banking services was not being delivered efficiently in rural areas because women had no control over their finances.\n",
            "\n",
            "“Most of the government benefits that are provided are sourced through the female head of the family. Since women have absolutely no control over money in these areas, these accounts are operated by the male members who simply withdraw the entire amount from the bank,” she said.\n",
            "\n",
            "\"Lack of trust between the rural borrowers and banks stemmed from the stringent eligibility criteria required for loan dispensation.”\n",
            "\n",
            "“More often than not, a villager ends up borrowing from the village sarpanch or the money lender on rates as high as 3 percent per day. Since villages are mostly a close-knit community, people find it easier to borrow from someone they know than to apply for a loan at the bank, which is not able to give them loans, because these people don't meet the eligibility criteria,” she added.\n",
            "\n",
            "“Despite the huge surge in the number of bank accounts post Pradhan Mantri Jan Dhan Yojana (PMJDY), the enthusiasm for banking fizzled out quickly. The beneficiaries misunderstood the stance of the Jan Dhan accounts and eagerly awaited for the Modi- promised Rs 15 Lakh in their accounts. When did not happen, people lost interest. They would withdraw whatever minimal amount they would have and never return to the bank again.”\n",
            "\n",
            "Another bank official at SBI, North Lakhimpur, Assam also cited the same misunderstanding related to the Jan Dhan accounts that people perceived while opening their accounts. He stated that, though people opened PMJDY accounts at a massive scale, the main agenda was lost because people from urban sector who already had bank accounts were more inclined towards the schemes and the account incentives in contradiction to the actual motive of the Yojna.\n",
            "\n",
            "“The Yojna was implemented to include the unbanked and under banked section of the society. Financial inclusion is taking place, and increasing post the Jan Dhan yojna but most people from the rural sector still find it scary to undergo the documentation process (submitting of Pan Cards, Aadhar card details, KYC update).\"\n",
            "\n",
            "A senior level manager working at Gramin Vikas Bank, who did not want to be named, said it was not an overnight process even though the PMJDY flagship programme of the Modi 1.0 government had brought about massive financial inclusion.\n",
            "\n",
            "“As Bank officials, it is our duty to bridge the gap between sections of the economy and encourage more inclusion into the formal banking system. Therefore, we visit unbanked and remotely banked villages every once a week to make the masses aware about finances and interest rates and how the government provides incentives on deposits in Jan Dhan accounts.”\n",
            "\n",
            "Rajat Kathuria, Director of Indian Council for Research on International Economic Relations (ICRIER), said that financial inclusion faced challenges from the Demand and Supply point of view.\n",

            "“The rural sector has no regular income, their deposit are meagre and transaction costs are high. Even if the number of deposits increase, the amount deposited per account is minimal from the rural sector. As a result, the cost servicing of these accounts is more in terms of keeping them operational.”\n",
            "\n",
            "“The government has implemented incentive in the form of the LPG schemes, social security benefits, pension plans etc., but most people do not understand the incentives with the scheme. Micro financial institutions have played a large scale role in implementing Jan Dhan Yojna. Cash flow in the banking sector has taken a rise, but total inclusion still faces challenges.”\n",
            "\n",
            "“Financial unawareness needs to be tackled. Micro finance institutions, schools, post offices, SIDBIs are playing a huge role in spreading financial literacy and with the advent of mobile phones in rural areas, a more comprehensive approach is building its way into financial inclusion.”\n",

            "Over the last three-four months, everybody has started to talk about electric vehicles (EV). Some parties such as the government and policy makers are in favour of it while other like automotive companies are busy searching for faults in the government’s diktat to 100 percent EV transition. This is the topic of discussion in today’s wrap, too, but here’s a look at all the major developments of the week in the automotive sector.\n",

            "\n",
            "The Centre has gone all out in pushing electric vehicles as the best choice for future mobility. In an effort to make electric vehicles more affordable, Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman has proposed to provide an income tax deduction of Rs 1.5 lakh on the interest paid on loan taken to buy EVs.\n",
            "\n",
            "This is the first time that electric vehicles have been proposed to become a direct tax beneficiary. The buyer of an EV can enjoy a total benefit of Rs 2.5 lakh over the purchase period, Sitharaman added.\n",

            "Jaguar CEO salary slashed\n",
            "\n",
            "The compensation of Jaguar Land Rover CEO Ralf Speth contracted by 21 percent during FY19 after the Tata Motors-owned British carmaker posted a loss of 3.3 billion pounds (approx Rs 29,000 crore).\n",
            "\n",
            "Speth took home Rs 31.82 crore in FY19, down from Rs 40.08 crore for FY18. The pay-out does not include encashable leave and gratuity, according to details given in the 74th annual report of Tata Motors.\n",

            "India will have 21mn vehicles scrapped\n",
            "\n",
            "India is the fourth-largest producer of automobiles in the world but does not have a vehicle scrapping policy in place. But, in the Economic Survey 2019, the government of India has put vehicle scrapping in the priority sector for enhancing the resource efficiency.\n",
            "\n",
            "As many as 21.8 million vehicles are expected to reach the end of life in six years, given the reducing average life of vehicle ownership.\n",
            "\n",
            "Not incentives but infra needed to push EV growth\n",
            "\n",
            "The Economic Survey has quoted studies showing that more than incentives offered to manufacturers and users, good charging infrastructure is key to mass adoption of electric vehicles (EVs). That is because the driving range of batteries in an electric vehicle is lower, compared to those which run on fossil fuel.\n",
            "\n",
            "“We find that the market share of EVs is positively related to the availability of chargers and larger availability of chargers corresponds to greater adoption of EVs. The market share of EVs increases with the increasing availability of charging infrastructure,” the survey said.\n",

            "MG Motor ties up with Fortum\n",
            "\n",
            "MG Motor India on July 2 said it had tied up with Fortum Charge & Drive India to set up charging stations for electric vehicles at its showrooms in five cities, including Delhi-NCR, ahead of the launch of its electric SUV, EZS, later in 2019.\n",
            "\n",
            "Under the partnership, Finland-based clean energy major Fortum will install 50 kW DC fast-charging EV stations at MG Motor India's showrooms in Delhi-NCR, Hyderabad, Mumbai, Bengaluru and Ahmedabad by September to begin with, the company said in a statement.\n",

            "Domestic car sales disappoint yet again\n",
            "\n",
            "The domestic car market yet again posted a disappointing set of numbers as poor buyer sentiments continued to affect retail car demand. Almost every carmaker reported a drop in wholesale volumes in June.\n",

            "Domestic sales of Maruti Suzuki slipped into the negative for the fourth consecutive month in June, recording a drop of 15 percent to 114,861 units as against the same month in 2018.\n",

            "\n",
            "Niti Aayog Head Amitabh Kant has raised the tempo several times over for making electric vehicles the mode of transport in the mid to long term future.\n",
            "\n",
            "The deadline for 100 percent conversion to electric for two-wheelers having engines below 150cc is 2025 and 2023 for three-wheelers. Now, Kant has ruffled quite a few features over the last few weeks.\n",
            "\n",
            "Kant is known to be close to Bajaj Auto MD Rajiv Bajaj who, at a press event held in New Delhi in January, praised Kant’s contribution in making the Qute quadricycle a reality.\n",
            "\n",
            "But, within six months, the situation changed. Bajaj, along with other well-known names from the auto industry such as TVS Motor Company Chairman and MD Venu Srinivasan, were forced to criticize Niti Aayog diktat over switch to 100 percent electric in 4-6 years.\n",
            "\n",
            "The two were later joined by Honda Motorcycle and Scooter India, the country’s second largest two-wheeler maker. They are asking for more lead time in venturing to electric vehicles as the industry gets ready to enter Bharat Stage VI (BS-VI) in a few months.\n",
            "\n",
            "The government of India believes that the thrust laid down by Niti Aayog over electric vehicles is not unfounded. To reduce dependence on imported oil and to arrest the erosion of foreign exchange reserves the automotive industry needs to move to electric mobility at the earliest period possible.\n",
            "\n",
            "This is why, for the first time ever, the government announced income tax deduction for those buying electric cars on loan. Buyers will benefit from Rs 1.5 lakh deduction on interest paid on loan of such cars.\n",
            "\n",
            "Industry players such as Mahindra & Mahindra MD Pawan Goenka, agreed that incentives such as income tax deduction would surely help in the faster adoption of electric vehicles. There is also an urgent need to have the manufacturing ecosystem for EVs in India.\n",
            "\n",
            "“A lithium-ion cells manufacturing plant will take a minimum of 2-3 years to commence operation. This is a highly specialized subject and it is not for everyone to enter the space. But to make India the hub of EV manufacturing it is absolutely essential to make the cells in India. Today only 60 percent of a Mahindra electric car is made in India and the rest is imported”, Goenka told Moneycontrol on July 5.\n",
            "\n",
            "The other favourite subject of automotive companies for starting a debate against electrification is the near-absence of charging stations. Most foreign brands such as Honda, Fiat, Ford, Toyota, Volkswagen and even Suzuki have the raised the issue of lack of charging infrastructure.\n",
            "\n",
            "But, Goenka says, “This is the classic ‘chicken-n-egg’ situation. We don’t have the cars to set up the charging stations and neither can we have the charging stations because there ar no cars. But at Mahindra we have not waited for the charging stations to come up because that way the EV transition will never happen.” Catch Budget 2019 LIVE updates here .

            "Article's Text:\n",
            "Siraj Hussain\n",
            "\n",
            "The first Budget of the Modi 2.0 government has disappointed most observers of the agriculture scene. They expected that the government, having won an unprecedented mandate, will kick in structural changes through the Budget. But the government’s refusal to take the plunge shows that victory in election is not enough to undertake deep reforms and a political consensus is required before decisions affecting crores of people can be taken.\n",
            "\n",
            "In the case of reforms in the financial sector, the finance minister did not feel a similar handicap. So, she did take several welcome steps towards reforms.\n",
            "\n",
            "The Modi 2.0 government was formed only on May 30 and it had just about a month to prepare the Budget proposals. In such a short time, it would not have been possible to consult the states, even if they are ruled by the BJP. After demonetisation, analysts are of the view that the government can take any decision in the interest of economy. But that was a one-off decision even if it affected every single individual in the country.\n",
            "\n",
            "Agricultural experts wished to see bold decision-making on rationalisation of food and fertiliser subsidies and cropping patterns. The observation is that even though direct benefit transfer through PM-Kisan was launched on the eve of Parliament elections, it has laid the foundation for direct transfer of subsidies in a phased manner and the government will present a road map for the same.\n",
            "\n",
            "For 2019-20, the Budget provides Rs 1.84 lakh crore and Rs 80,000 crore for food and fertiliser subsidies. In 2018-19, the government had provided Rs 1.40 lakh crore towards food subsidy to the Food Corporation of India (FCI) and Rs 31,000 crore for state governments, which procure food grains under the decentralised procurement scheme (DCP). In the interim Budget presented on February 1, the allocations were increased in revised estimate (RE) to Rs 1.51 lakh crore and Rs 33,000 crore, respectively.\n",
            "\n",
            "But the government did not pay the RE amount, and the FCI received Rs 69,000 crore less than RE. The outstanding dues of the FCI reached Rs 1.85 lakh crore as on March 31. DCP states are also running with substantial arrears of food subsidy though the amount is not known as the data are not released by the government. In fact, one of the reasons why the states are reluctant to undertake procurement at MSP is the delay in reimbursement of subsidy, even for rice and wheat. The states end up incurring substantial losses in procurement. Chhattisgarh and Odisha have been representing to the Centre about the delay in reimbursement of food subsidy.\n",
            "\n",
            "Similarly, the government owes Rs 30,000 crore to fertiliser companies as arrear of fertiliser subsidy.\n",
            "\n",
            "Sitharaman’s Budget for 2020 made no reference to mounting arrears of food subsidy. We wanted to hear the FM on her government’s thinking on reform of food subsidy regime. A road map to switch to DBT for food in at least agriculturally surplus states like Punjab, Haryana and Andhra Pradesh was expected in the Budget, but it seems that the government did not want to touch it even after a huge mandate.\n",
            "\n",
            "Even the Economic Survey only talked about end-to-end computerisation of public distribution system. For a large number of migrants working at places away from their home, DBT for food is the road to one nation, one ration card. But it was not to be.\n",
            "\n",
            "For phosphatic and potassic fertilisers, the UPA had brought Nutrient Based Subsidy Scheme in 2010. In the five years of the Modi 1.0 government, subsidy on urea was not touched. The Budget for 2020 again does not provide any road map for that.\n",
            "\n",
            "The FM mentioned zero based budget farming, which has been undertaken in some coastal districts of Andhra Pradesh. Without any reform in fertiliser subsidy regime, it is unrealistic to expect farmers to use less urea and switch over to organic farming.\n",
            "\n",
            "Several regions of India are reeling under drought and water stress has become one of the most pressing challenges for farming. The FM took notice of this and mentioned that there are 1,592 critical and over exploited blocks. But she did not indicate how the government proposes to address this enormous challenge.\n",
            "\n",
            "Experts have been writing about the need to modify cropping patterns in several regions of India. There is no doubt that it is not going to be an easy exercise, but a token provision in the Budget would have shown the government’s seriousness to tackle this challenge.\n",
            "\n",
            "There is a realisation that farmers can realise better prices only if marketing reforms are undertaken. The FM did mention it in passing, but it would require a lot of convincing of state governments as APMCs would not easily let their influence go. A more emphatic statement in the Budget speech would have given a signal of the government’s commitment to reform the agricultural markets.\n",
            "\n",
            "The FM has spoken about promotion of milk sector through cooperatives. In the past 10 years, the private sector has taken lead in setting up milk processing plants. In several large states, like UP, the procurement of milk by cooperatives has gone down. If the Food Safety and Standard Authority of India (FSSAI) is as strict with the unorganised sector as it is with the organised one, the milk sector can see large investment by private players.\n",
            "\n",
            "Even though doubling of farm income does not find a mention in the Budget speech, allied sectors like rearing of animals, dairy, fisheries, forestry etc do provide a window for increase in farmers income, especially in poorer states in east India.\n",
            "\n",
            "Modi 2.0 has set up a high-powered committee of chief ministers for transformation of Indian agriculture. It seems that the government wants to wait for report of the committee and then build a consensus on road map for deep reforms in agriculture and food sector.\n",
            "\n",
            "Till then, expect the rural demand to remain muted.\n",

            "Article's Text:\n",
            "Over the last three-four months, everybody has started to talk about electric vehicles (EV). Some parties such as the government and policy makers are in favour of it while other like automotive companies are busy searching for faults in the government’s diktat to 100 percent EV transition. This is the topic of discussion in today’s wrap, too, but here’s a look at all the major developments of the week in the automotive sector.\n",
            "\n",
            "Income tax deduction on electric vehicle buys\n",
            "\n",
            "The Centre has gone all out in pushing electric vehicles as the best choice for future mobility. In an effort to make electric vehicles more affordable, Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman has proposed to provide an income tax deduction of Rs 1.5 lakh on the interest paid on loan taken to buy EVs.\n",
            "\n",
            "This is the first time that electric vehicles have been proposed to become a direct tax beneficiary. The buyer of an EV can enjoy a total benefit of Rs 2.5 lakh over the purchase period, Sitharaman added.\n",
            "\n",
            "Jaguar CEO salary slashed\n",
            "\n",
            "The compensation of Jaguar Land Rover CEO Ralf Speth contracted by 21 percent during FY19 after the Tata Motors-owned British carmaker posted a loss of 3.3 billion pounds (approx Rs 29,000 crore).\n",
            "\n",
            "Speth took home Rs 31.82 crore in FY19, down from Rs 40.08 crore for FY18. The pay-out does not include encashable leave and gratuity, according to details given in the 74th annual report of Tata Motors.\n",
            "\n",
            "India will have 21mn vehicles scrapped\n",
            "\n",
            "India is the fourth-largest producer of automobiles in the world but does not have a vehicle scrapping policy in place. But, in the Economic Survey 2019, the government of India has put vehicle scrapping in the priority sector for enhancing the resource efficiency.\n",
            "\n",
            "As many as 21.8 million vehicles are expected to reach the end of life in six years, given the reducing average life of vehicle ownership.\n",
            "\n",
            "Not incentives but infra needed to push EV growth\n",
            "\n",
            "The Economic Survey has quoted studies showing that more than incentives offered to manufacturers and users, good charging infrastructure is key to mass adoption of electric vehicles (EVs). That is because the driving range of batteries in an electric vehicle is lower, compared to those which run on fossil fuel.\n",
            "\n",
            "“We find that the market share of EVs is positively related to the availability of chargers and larger availability of chargers corresponds to greater adoption of EVs. The market share of EVs increases with the increasing availability of charging infrastructure,” the survey said.\n",
            "\n",
            "MG Motor ties up with Fortum\n",
            "\n",
            "MG Motor India on July 2 said it had tied up with Fortum Charge & Drive India to set up charging stations for electric vehicles at its showrooms in five cities, including Delhi-NCR, ahead of the launch of its electric SUV, EZS, later in 2019.\n",
            "\n",
            "Under the partnership, Finland-based clean energy major Fortum will install 50 kW DC fast-charging EV stations at MG Motor India's showrooms in Delhi-NCR, Hyderabad, Mumbai, Bengaluru and Ahmedabad by September to begin with, the company said in a statement.\n",
            "\n",
            "Domestic car sales disappoint yet again\n",
            "\n",
            "The domestic car market yet again posted a disappointing set of numbers as poor buyer sentiments continued to affect retail car demand. Almost every carmaker reported a drop in wholesale volumes in June.\n",
            "\n",
            "Domestic sales of Maruti Suzuki slipped into the negative for the fourth consecutive month in June, recording a drop of 15 percent to 114,861 units as against the same month in 2018.\n",
            "\n",
            "The EV revolution that Niti Aayog needs so desperately\n",
            "\n",
            "Niti Aayog Head Amitabh Kant has raised the tempo several times over for making electric vehicles the mode of transport in the mid to long term future.\n",
            "\n",
            "The deadline for 100 percent conversion to electric for two-wheelers having engines below 150cc is 2025 and 2023 for three-wheelers. Now, Kant has ruffled quite a few features over the last few weeks.\n",
            "\n",
            "Kant is known to be close to Bajaj Auto MD Rajiv Bajaj who, at a press event held in New Delhi in January, praised Kant’s contribution in making the Qute quadricycle a reality.\n",
            "\n",
            "But, within six months, the situation changed. Bajaj, along with other well-known names from the auto industry such as TVS Motor Company Chairman and MD Venu Srinivasan, were forced to criticize Niti Aayog diktat over switch to 100 percent electric in 4-6 years.\n",
            "\n",
            "The two were later joined by Honda Motorcycle and Scooter India, the country’s second largest two-wheeler maker. They are asking for more lead time in venturing to electric vehicles as the industry gets ready to enter Bharat Stage VI (BS-VI) in a few months.\n",
            "\n",
            "The government of India believes that the thrust laid down by Niti Aayog over electric vehicles is not unfounded. To reduce dependence on imported oil and to arrest the erosion of foreign exchange reserves the automotive industry needs to move to electric mobility at the earliest period possible.\n",
            "\n",
            "This is why, for the first time ever, the government announced income tax deduction for those buying electric cars on loan. Buyers will benefit from Rs 1.5 lakh deduction on interest paid on loan of such cars.\n",
            "\n",
            "Industry players such as Mahindra & Mahindra MD Pawan Goenka, agreed that incentives such as income tax deduction would surely help in the faster adoption of electric vehicles. There is also an urgent need to have the manufacturing ecosystem for EVs in India.\n",
            "\n",
            "“A lithium-ion cells manufacturing plant will take a minimum of 2-3 years to commence operation. This is a highly specialized subject and it is not for everyone to enter the space. But to make India the hub of EV manufacturing it is absolutely essential to make the cells in India. Today only 60 percent of a Mahindra electric car is made in India and the rest is imported”, Goenka told Moneycontrol on July 5.\n",
            "\n",
            "The other favourite subject of automotive companies for starting a debate against electrification is the near-absence of charging stations. Most foreign brands such as Honda, Fiat, Ford, Toyota, Volkswagen and even Suzuki have the raised the issue of lack of charging infrastructure.\n",
            "\n",
            "But, Goenka says, “This is the classic ‘chicken-n-egg’ situation. We don’t have the cars to set up the charging stations and neither can we have the charging stations because there ar no cars. But at Mahindra we have not waited for the charging stations to come up because that way the EV transition will never happen.” Catch Budget 2019 LIVE updates here .

The vision for the second term is driven by the expansion of physical and financial infrastructure, Digital India, Make in India, start-ups, giving clear signs that India has a clear plan to challenge the manufacturing strength of China.\n",

The scheme will also include units in the fields of solar photovoltaic cells, lithium storage batteries, solar electric charging infrastructure, computers servers, laptops etc. In order to incentivise them, they are offered investment-linked income tax deduction and certain indirect tax benefits.\n",

            "Digital transactions have led to increased transparency and tax collections so far. In order to move further, a 2 percent TDS has been proposed on cash withdrawals exceeding Rs 1 crore in a financial year from a bank account.

This might lead many MNCs listed on Indian exchanges to consider the option of delisting, if increased public shareholding is implemented.

            "Siraj Hussain\n",
            "\n",
            "The first Budget of the Modi 2.0 government has disappointed most observers of the agriculture scene. They expected that the government, having won an unprecedented mandate, will kick in structural changes through the Budget. But the government’s refusal to take the plunge shows that victory in election is not enough to undertake deep reforms and a political consensus is required before decisions affecting crores of people can be taken.\n",
            "\n",
            "In the case of reforms in the financial sector, the finance minister did not feel a similar handicap. So, she did take several welcome steps towards reforms.\n",
            "\n",
            "The Modi 2.0 government was formed only on May 30 and it had just about a month to prepare the Budget proposals. In such a short time, it would not have been possible to consult the states, even if they are ruled by the BJP. After demonetisation, analysts are of the view that the government can take any decision in the interest of economy. But that was a one-off decision even if it affected every single individual in the country.\n",
            "\n",
            "Agricultural experts wished to see bold decision-making on rationalisation of food and fertiliser subsidies and cropping patterns. The observation is that even though direct benefit transfer through PM-Kisan was launched on the eve of Parliament elections, it has laid the foundation for direct transfer of subsidies in a phased manner and the government will present a road map for the same.\n",
            "\n",
            "For 2019-20, the Budget provides Rs 1.84 lakh crore and Rs 80,000 crore for food and fertiliser subsidies. In 2018-19, the government had provided Rs 1.40 lakh crore towards food subsidy to the Food Corporation of India (FCI) and Rs 31,000 crore for state governments, which procure food grains under the decentralised procurement scheme (DCP). In the interim Budget presented on February 1, the allocations were increased in revised estimate (RE) to Rs 1.51 lakh crore and Rs 33,000 crore, respectively.\n",
            "\n",
            "But the government did not pay the RE amount, and the FCI received Rs 69,000 crore less than RE. The outstanding dues of the FCI reached Rs 1.85 lakh crore as on March 31. DCP states are also running with substantial arrears of food subsidy though the amount is not known as the data are not released by the government. In fact, one of the reasons why the states are reluctant to undertake procurement at MSP is the delay in reimbursement of subsidy, even for rice and wheat. The states end up incurring substantial losses in procurement. Chhattisgarh and Odisha have been representing to the Centre about the delay in reimbursement of food subsidy.\n",
            "\n",
            "Similarly, the government owes Rs 30,000 crore to fertiliser companies as arrear of fertiliser subsidy.\n",
            "\n",
            "Sitharaman’s Budget for 2020 made no reference to mounting arrears of food subsidy. We wanted to hear the FM on her government’s thinking on reform of food subsidy regime. A road map to switch to DBT for food in at least agriculturally surplus states like Punjab, Haryana and Andhra Pradesh was expected in the Budget, but it seems that the government did not want to touch it even after a huge mandate.\n",
            "\n",
            "Even the Economic Survey only talked about end-to-end computerisation of public distribution system. For a large number of migrants working at places away from their home, DBT for food is the road to one nation, one ration card. But it was not to be.\n",
            "\n",
            "For phosphatic and potassic fertilisers, the UPA had brought Nutrient Based Subsidy Scheme in 2010. In the five years of the Modi 1.0 government, subsidy on urea was not touched. The Budget for 2020 again does not provide any road map for that.\n",
            "\n",
            "The FM mentioned zero based budget farming, which has been undertaken in some coastal districts of Andhra Pradesh. Without any reform in fertiliser subsidy regime, it is unrealistic to expect farmers to use less urea and switch over to organic farming.\n",
            "\n",
            "Several regions of India are reeling under drought and water stress has become one of the most pressing challenges for farming. The FM took notice of this and mentioned that there are 1,592 critical and over exploited blocks. But she did not indicate how the government proposes to address this enormous challenge.\n",
            "\n",
            "Experts have been writing about the need to modify cropping patterns in several regions of India. There is no doubt that it is not going to be an easy exercise, but a token provision in the Budget would have shown the government’s seriousness to tackle this challenge.\n",
            "\n",
            "There is a realisation that farmers can realise better prices only if marketing reforms are undertaken. The FM did mention it in passing, but it would require a lot of convincing of state governments as APMCs would not easily let their influence go. A more emphatic statement in the Budget speech would have given a signal of the government’s commitment to reform the agricultural markets.\n",
            "\n",
            "The FM has spoken about promotion of milk sector through cooperatives. In the past 10 years, the private sector has taken lead in setting up milk processing plants. In several large states, like UP, the procurement of milk by cooperatives has gone down. If the Food Safety and Standard Authority of India (FSSAI) is as strict with the unorganised sector as it is with the organised one, the milk sector can see large investment by private players.\n",
            "\n",
            "Even though doubling of farm income does not find a mention in the Budget speech, allied sectors like rearing of animals, dairy, fisheries, forestry etc do provide a window for increase in farmers income, especially in poorer states in east India.\n",
            "\n",
            "Modi 2.0 has set up a high-powered committee of chief ministers for transformation of Indian agriculture. It seems that the government wants to wait for report of the committee and then build a consensus on road map for deep reforms in agriculture and food sector.\n",
            "\n",
            "Till then, expect the rural demand to remain muted.\n",

            "In the Union Budget presented on July 5, the government took measures to resolve liquidity issues of both banks and NBFCs, which had been reeling under bad loan pressure, by way of capital infusion of Rs 70,000 crore into PSU banks. It would open funding avenues for financially-sound NBFCs and provide partial credit guarantee for public sector banks for the purchase of pooled assets of financially-sound NBFCs.\n",
            "\n",
            "The government’s move to vest the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) with additional power over NBFCs and Housing Finance companies will streamline regulations and implementations. This is expected to provide more uniform regulatory environment to the lending segment. Steps have been taken through tax measures to bring deposit taking NBFCs and systematically important non-deposit taking NBFCs at par with banks and other public financial institutions. Measures to support financially sound NBFCs and higher regulatory RBI monitoring will lead to drive for consolidation of NBFCs.\n",
            "\n",
            "The government has proposed several measures to boost debt markets. To enhance the sources for infrastructure financing, it was proposed to set up of Credit Guarantee Enhancement Corporation and have an action plan for deepening the corporate bond repos, credit default swaps etc.\n",
            "\n",
            "In the tri-party repo market in corporate debt securities, an arrangement to allow AA-rated bonds as collaterals was envisaged. It was proposed to allow investments made by FIIs/FPIs in debt securities issued by Infrastructure Debt Fund – Non-Bank Finance Companies (IDF-NBFCs) to be transferred/sold to any domestic investor within the specified lock-in period. These measures should significantly ease liquidity and provide much needed impetus to infrastructure and real estate. Simplified KYC norms for FPI and move to streamline NRI investment are also steps in the right direction.\n",
            "\n",
            "For the insurance sector, there were announcements with respect to increase in FDI from 49 percent to 100 percent for insurance intermediaries and reduction of the net-owned fund requirement for re-insurers to join IFSC from INR50 billion to Rs 10 billion, This will further encourage more insurance companies to set up operations in India. 100 percent FDI in insurance intermediaries will help in building distribution scale and penetration of insurance. This may also result in strong alternate distribution channel in addition to bancassurance.\n",
            "\n",
            "True to its commitment to further promote the IFSC, several tax incentives have been announced such as an enhanced holiday scheme with added flexibility, tax exemption for interest paid on external borrowings, relaxation on certain distribution taxes and expansion in scope of securities (including securities held by certain Category III AIFs) eligible for tax exemption on trading in the IFSC. Further, there is a plan to develop an aircraft financing and leasing hub within the IFSC.\n",

            "\n",
            "In 2014, the Modi 1.0 government launched the Pradhan Mantri Jan Dhan Yojana (PMJDY) in a bid to bring about this rural population into mainstream of banking and finance.\n",

            "This “people’s wealth” programme was formulated in order to bring about financial inclusion and provide low-cost, affordable financial services to everyone in the country especially for the rural economy. PMJDY was implemented to reduce disposable income and marked the advent of Direct Bank Transfers (DBT) to bank accounts.\n",
            "\n",
            "This flagship scheme led to a surge in the number of bank accounts that were opened in the wake. Given the many benefits underlined it, which included zero balance account and insurance cover of Rs 2,00,000, the scheme was bound to be a thriving success. Each beneficiary was also issued a RuPay debit card for ATM withdrawals, along with an overdraft facility of Rs 10,000.\n",

            "He further added, “As per the unbanked places are concerned, the physical strain of visiting the banks have also stopped the rural people from indulging in the financial spectrum of the economy. Hence they find it beneficial to visit money lenders and borrow money via oral dealings.”\n",
            "\n",
            "Singh stated, “Financial literacy is extremely important for total inclusion as most people belonging to the rural sector find banking extremely scary whether in term of lending borrowing or even the documentation process.

            "“Most of the government benefits that are provided are sourced through the female head of the family. Since women have absolutely no control over money in these areas, these accounts are operated by the male members who simply withdraw the entire amount from the bank,” she said.\n",

            "“Despite the huge surge in the number of bank accounts post Pradhan Mantri Jan Dhan Yojana (PMJDY), the enthusiasm for banking fizzled out quickly. The beneficiaries misunderstood the stance of the Jan Dhan accounts and eagerly awaited for the Modi- promised Rs 15 Lakh in their accounts. When did not happen, people lost interest. They would withdraw whatever minimal amount they would have and never return to the bank again.”\n",

            "Article's Text:\n",
            "Over the last three-four months, everybody has started to talk about electric vehicles (EV). Some parties such as the government and policy makers are in favour of it while other like automotive companies are busy searching for faults in the government’s diktat to 100 percent EV transition. This is the topic of discussion in today’s wrap, too, but here’s a look at all the major developments of the week in the automotive sector.\n",
            "\n",
            "Income tax deduction on electric vehicle buys\n",
            "\n",
            "The Centre has gone all out in pushing electric vehicles as the best choice for future mobility. In an effort to make electric vehicles more affordable, Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman has proposed to provide an income tax deduction of Rs 1.5 lakh on the interest paid on loan taken to buy EVs.\n",
            "\n",
            "This is the first time that electric vehicles have been proposed to become a direct tax beneficiary. The buyer of an EV can enjoy a total benefit of Rs 2.5 lakh over the purchase period, Sitharaman added.\n",
            "\n",
            "Jaguar CEO salary slashed\n",
            "\n",
            "The compensation of Jaguar Land Rover CEO Ralf Speth contracted by 21 percent during FY19 after the Tata Motors-owned British carmaker posted a loss of 3.3 billion pounds (approx Rs 29,000 crore).\n",
            "\n",
            "Speth took home Rs 31.82 crore in FY19, down from Rs 40.08 crore for FY18. The pay-out does not include encashable leave and gratuity, according to details given in the 74th annual report of Tata Motors.\n",
            "\n",
            "India will have 21mn vehicles scrapped\n",
            "\n",
            "India is the fourth-largest producer of automobiles in the world but does not have a vehicle scrapping policy in place. But, in the Economic Survey 2019, the government of India has put vehicle scrapping in the priority sector for enhancing the resource efficiency.\n",
            "\n",
            "As many as 21.8 million vehicles are expected to reach the end of life in six years, given the reducing average life of vehicle ownership.\n",
            "\n",
            "Not incentives but infra needed to push EV growth\n",
            "\n",
            "The Economic Survey has quoted studies showing that more than incentives offered to manufacturers and users, good charging infrastructure is key to mass adoption of electric vehicles (EVs). That is because the driving range of batteries in an electric vehicle is lower, compared to those which run on fossil fuel.\n",
            "\n",
            "“We find that the market share of EVs is positively related to the availability of chargers and larger availability of chargers corresponds to greater adoption of EVs. The market share of EVs increases with the increasing availability of charging infrastructure,” the survey said.\n",
            "\n",
            "MG Motor ties up with Fortum\n",
            "\n",
            "MG Motor India on July 2 said it had tied up with Fortum Charge & Drive India to set up charging stations for electric vehicles at its showrooms in five cities, including Delhi-NCR, ahead of the launch of its electric SUV, EZS, later in 2019.\n",
            "\n",
            "Under the partnership, Finland-based clean energy major Fortum will install 50 kW DC fast-charging EV stations at MG Motor India's showrooms in Delhi-NCR, Hyderabad, Mumbai, Bengaluru and Ahmedabad by September to begin with, the company said in a statement.\n",

            "Domestic car sales disappoint yet again\n",
            "\n",
            "The domestic car market yet again posted a disappointing set of numbers as poor buyer sentiments continued to affect retail car demand. Almost every carmaker reported a drop in wholesale volumes in June.\n",
            "\n",
            "Domestic sales of Maruti Suzuki slipped into the negative for the fourth consecutive month in June, recording a drop of 15 percent to 114,861 units as against the same month in 2018.\n",

            "\n",
            "Niti Aayog Head Amitabh Kant has raised the tempo several times over for making electric vehicles the mode of transport in the mid to long term future.\n",
            "\n",
            "The deadline for 100 percent conversion to electric for two-wheelers having engines below 150cc is 2025 and 2023 for three-wheelers. Now, Kant has ruffled quite a few features over the last few weeks.\n",
            "\n",
            "Kant is known to be close to Bajaj Auto MD Rajiv Bajaj who, at a press event held in New Delhi in January, praised Kant’s contribution in making the Qute quadricycle a reality.\n",
            "\n",
            "But, within six months, the situation changed. Bajaj, along with other well-known names from the auto industry such as TVS Motor Company Chairman and MD Venu Srinivasan, were forced to criticize Niti Aayog diktat over switch to 100 percent electric in 4-6 years.\n",
            "\n",
            "The two were later joined by Honda Motorcycle and Scooter India, the country’s second largest two-wheeler maker. They are asking for more lead time in venturing to electric vehicles as the industry gets ready to enter Bharat Stage VI (BS-VI) in a few months.\n",
            "\n",
            "The government of India believes that the thrust laid down by Niti Aayog over electric vehicles is not unfounded. To reduce dependence on imported oil and to arrest the erosion of foreign exchange reserves the automotive industry needs to move to electric mobility at the earliest period possible.\n",
            "\n",
            "This is why, for the first time ever, the government announced income tax deduction for those buying electric cars on loan. Buyers will benefit from Rs 1.5 lakh deduction on interest paid on loan of such cars.\n",
            "\n",
            "Industry players such as Mahindra & Mahindra MD Pawan Goenka, agreed that incentives such as income tax deduction would surely help in the faster adoption of electric vehicles. There is also an urgent need to have the manufacturing ecosystem for EVs in India.\n",
            "\n",
            "“A lithium-ion cells manufacturing plant will take a minimum of 2-3 years to commence operation. This is a highly specialized subject and it is not for everyone to enter the space. But to make India the hub of EV manufacturing it is absolutely essential to make the cells in India. Today only 60 percent of a Mahindra electric car is made in India and the rest is imported”, Goenka told Moneycontrol on July 5.\n",
            "\n",
            "The other favourite subject of automotive companies for starting a debate against electrification is the near-absence of charging stations. Most foreign brands such as Honda, Fiat, Ford, Toyota, Volkswagen and even Suzuki have the raised the issue of lack of charging infrastructure.\n",
            "\n",
            "But, Goenka says, “This is the classic ‘chicken-n-egg’ situation. We don’t have the cars to set up the charging stations and neither can we have the charging stations because there ar no cars. But at Mahindra we have not waited for the charging stations to come up because that way the EV transition will never happen.” Catch Budget 2019 LIVE updates here .

But that's what consistent performances and hard work get you. Really proud and happy of our team. Most amazing team to be a part of. It is a really honor to play for India. More or less everything is set. But we don't want to be one dimensional, I think the team that is more flexible on the day has more chances of executing what they want to. Obviously the dimensions and the pitches we play on will matter a lot, so we need a good balance in the side and whatever combination provides us the balance we will go ahead with that and really feel confident if we are batting first or bowling first we are covered with all dimensions. From that point of view we are happy with where we are placed. It is just about turning up on the semifinal day and putting up a performance. The opposition has never mattered. We don't focus on what the opposition brings to the table. If we don't play well anyone can beat us and if we play well we can beat anyone. The focus has to be within and we are confidence of our skill sets. We just want to go out there in the semifinal and express our skills and strengths as a team. So regardless of who we will play, we want to play good cricket and get the result our way. He has been outstanding especially after being under the pump in the first 3-4 games, but he has come back beautifully, so he's really motivated and is thinking like a batsman. He has a gut feel as to what the batter might do, so he's trying different things.\n",

            "It may be an uncanny coincidence that Moitra’s speech came a day before Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman presented Budget 2019 that included a number of references to Aadhaar. Sitharaman’s proposal effectively made it possible to replace a PAN card with an Aadhaar card. It is possible to do so not only while filing income tax returns, but whenever a PAN card is required.\n",

            "\"This bill strikes at the very heart of the primacy of an individual and privacy of an individual's data. This is what the Supreme Court in their judgment also tried to talk about. There are three very problematic clauses in this amended bill,\" she said.\n",

Obviously the dimensions and the pitches we play on will matter a lot, so we need a good balance in the side and whatever combination provides us the balance we will go ahead with that and really feel confident if we are batting first or bowling first we are covered with all dimensions. From that point of view we are happy with where we are placed. It is just about turning up on the semifinal day and putting up a performance. The opposition has never mattered. We don't focus on what the opposition brings to the table. If we don't play well anyone can beat us and if we play well we can beat anyone. The focus has to be within and we are confidence of our skill sets. We just want to go out there in the semifinal and express our skills and strengths as a team. So regardless of who we will play, we want to play good cricket and get the result our way.

However, the job is accompanied by the risks of low pay and fear of retrenchment.\n",

Some NBFCs and HFCs even today are able to raise funding for their lending programme, some may not be able to raise the whole amount but are raising a substantial part of it. Finally there are some that are facing real constraints. But it has also happened together that a general atmosphere of risk aversion has build up. Banks, MFs (mutual funds) are holding themselves back. This announcement is to tackle this risk aversion.

            "Article's Text:\n",
            "The Indian government's maiden plan to issue sovereign bonds to the world to raise funds for a part of its debt overseas, could be initiated in the second half of the borrowing calendar, Finance Secretary Subhash Chandra Garg told Moneycontrol.\n",
            "\n",
            "\"The first round of borrowings always take time to figure out the modalities, understanding processes, create enabling arrangements for payments of interest, tax deductions etc. My best call is by the time we do the second half of the borrowing calendar, we'll be able to figure it out,\" Garg said.\n",
            "\n",
            "In her maiden budget, Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman announced the government's plan to raise part of its gross borrowing requirements via foreign currency borrowings.\n",
            "\n",
            "The announcement gave rise to concerns from the financial sector analysts and market participants that it might open India up to the risks of getting affected by the volatility of global financial markets.\n",
            "\n",
            "Calling such fears as being off the mark, Garg says that the Indian government's exposure to foreign currency is less than 5 percent of the GDP, which keeps it well insulated from pressures of external volatility.\n",
            "\n",
            "\"It has been very carefully announced that only a part of government's borrowing programme will be raised overseas so it's not any additional debt. So long as the overall borrowing remains within established limits, it's not a cause of concern. Our foreign currency exposure is less than 5 percent of GDP. Government's exposure is very small. The private sector's is much bigger with the ECBs and others,\" Garg said.\n",
            "\n",
            "The budget also projects that the government would earn Rs 106,041.56 crore as dividends from RBI and banks in 2019-20, up 43 percent from Rs 74,140.37 crore in the previous year. The assumption behind such a robust collection was the likely profits of RBI for 2018-19.\n",
            "\n",
            "\"RBI's asset size has gone up, profitability has gone up and our estimate of the dividend is based on that,\" Garg said.\n",
            "\n",
            "Th interchangeability of the PAN and Aadhar announced in the budget has also given rise to concerns that the government might want to phase out PAN.\n",
            "\n",
            "\"I don't think that's the intention at all. We need to wait for more detailed instructions. In the interest of ease of doing business, tax department is enabling the use of Aadhaar. Don't think there is any move to do away with PAN, it serves for a different kind of use,\" Garg said.\n",
            "\n",
            "The budget also announced that the government would encourage public sector banks to buy high-rated pooled assets of up to Rs 1 trillion of financially sound NBFCs, for which the government will provide a one-time six-month partial credit guarantee for the first loss of up to 10 percent.\n",
            "\n",
            "The banks can buy assets of NBFCs up to Rs 1 trillion during FY20. Following this, Reserve Bank of India (RBI) issued a notification saying that it has opened an indirect liquidity window for the sector to aid banks to give funds to the sector.\n",
            "\n",
            "Calling the announcements huge confidence building exercises, the finance secretary said that if the announcements is able to meet the desired result, the normalcy will be restored in the NBFC sector.\n",
            "\n",
            "\"NBFCs and HFCs are not a monolithic construct. Some NBFCs and HFCs even today are able to raise funding for their lending programme, some may not be able to raise the whole amount but are raising a substantial part of it. Finally there are some that are facing real constraints. But it has also happened together that a general atmosphere of risk aversion has build up. Banks, MFs (mutual funds) are holding themselves back. This announcement is to tackle this risk aversion. If you think there is risk in their papers which you can lend against, then we are prepared to bear first loss. That will build confidence. It's a massive large confidence building exercise and if it manages to do that, normalcy will be restored,\" Garg said. Catch Budget 2019 LIVE updates here .
